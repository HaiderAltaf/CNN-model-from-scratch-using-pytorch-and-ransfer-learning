# CS6910 Assignment-2

The assignment contains two parts.
In Part-A, I have build CNN model from scratch using pytorch to train on iNaturalist dataset.
In Part-B, I have iported pretrained VGG16 CNN model using pytorch and modified it to make suitable for iNaturalist dataset(having only 10k train images).
